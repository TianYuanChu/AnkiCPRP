## About Using Authorization keys with PuTTy and SSH:
##
####################################

Using the authorized_key file to log in SSH provides easier access and better security.

private/public keys are already provided for each user at this stage, but if you want to set up one on your self, or not sure how to use them, please follow the steps below:

(1) You need to ssh into the server with your user name and password
(2) Create private/public keys
	- cd
	  mkdir .ssh
	  ssh-keygen -t rsa //or simply ssh-keygen
	- Follow the steps prompted. If you do not want to use a passphrase as an extra level of security, just press Enter when prompted. The ssh-keygen command will create two files in the .ssh directory, ida_rsa.pub and ida_rsa, or whatever you named them during prompt.

(3) Create "authorized_keys" file if not existed already
	- sudo nano /Users/[short username]/.ssh/authorized_keys
	- The file must start with: (if not, add it in begining)
	command="/usr/local/aliasbin/svnserve -t --tunnel-user=[short username] -r /svn" ssh-dsa 
(4) Add public key in authorized_keys
	- sudo cat [filename for public key i.e. ida_rsa.pub] >> authorized_keys
	  sudo chown -R .ssh
	  sudo chmod 700 .ssh
	  sudo chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
(5) *For MAC clients*
	ssh-add -K .ssh/id_whatever_your_rivate_key_is
    *For Windows*
	- You need two things: puttygen.exe; putty.exe and tortoise
NOW open puttygen.exe
under actions select "load" and load the id_dsa file
enter the passphrase you set when you generated the key on the server. Puttygen will now convert the key to something that putty will understand
save that file to something like
pivatekey.ppk
NOW change your putty settings under "connection > SSH > auth" to use
privatekey.ppk
NOW try and connect
	- In Tortoise Setting > Network >SSH Client, add:
	  [your TortoiseSVN directory]\bin\TortoisePlink.exe
